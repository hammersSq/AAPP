# Definition 
==An **amortized analysis** is  any strategy for analyzing a sequence of operations to show that the average cost per operation is small, even though a single operation within the sequence might be expansive.==

In Amortized analysis we are not talking of probability, we are giving guarantees about the average performance of each operation in the **worst case**

# Method
There are 3 common way to do amortized analysis:
- The **Aggregate Method**
- The **Accounting Method**
- The **Potential Method**

The first one is the simpler but it lack of precision, the other two allow a specific amortized cost to be allocated to each operation.

## Aggregate Method
This simply consists in a sum of all the cost for the n operation and the a division by n (we are calculating the average cost). It is very simple

## Accounting method
It work assuming you have a bank account:
- Each time you do a specific operation you have to pay 1.
- The balance cannot go negative
- To not go negative each time you have to pay 1 you charge c*<sub>i</sub> , that is the amortized cost. In this way you are creating an upper bound for the total true cost

## Potential method
Is similar to the bank account method but you see the bank account as the potential energy.
- You start from an initial state
- Then you have a sequence of operation **i** that transform  **state<sub>i-1</sub>** in **state<sub>i</sub>**
- the cost of operation i is c<sub>i</sub>
- define a **potential function**  Φ : {State <sub>i</sub>}->R (R=Real number):
	- Φ(state<sub>0</sub>)=0
	- Φ(state<sub>i</sub>)>=0 for each i
- The amortized cost c*<sub>i</sub> with respect to Φ is defined as:
	- **c*<sub>i</sub> =c<sub>i</sub> +Φ(state<sub>i</sub>) -Φ(state<sub>i-1</sub>)**

**If Φ<sub>i</sub> >0 then c*<sub>i</sub> > c<sub>i</sub> Operation i stores work in the data structure for later use.**

**If Φ<sub>i</sub> <0 then c*<sub>i</sub> < c<sub>i</sub> . The operation i used the stored work to be completed**

The image above show how the amortized cost is an upper bound for the real cost


# Dynamic Table 
The dynamic table is a good example to apply amortized cost.

## The problem
We want a data structure with a dynamic size. It has to increase its size when we try to add an element and the data structure is full. A good idea is to double the size each time there is an overflow

## Analysis
Consider a sequence of **n** insertions. What is the worst case time to execute one insertions? it is Theta(n), the case we have to copy the element in the new list!
But we cannot say that the worst case for inserting n element is Theta(n<sup>2</sup>) because in n insertion not always happen that we have to copy all the element.

This is a case when amortized analysis can help us.

### Aggregate method for dynamic table

Let c<sub>i</sub>= the cost of the **i**-th insertions:
- c<sub>i</sub>=**i** if i-1 is an exact power of 2
- 1 otherwise

We can calculate the cost of **n** insertions as:

Dividing them by n, we obtain the amortized cost for one insertions:
3n/3 = n = Theta(1)!

### Accounting method for dynamic table
We can obtain the same result using the accounting method
lets select an amortized cost c*<sub>i</sub> =3

- you pay 1 for the immediate insertion
- 2 are stored in the balance 
When the table doubles, you pay 1 to move a recent item, and 1 to move an old item.

The bank balance never drops below 0. Thus, the sum of amortized costs provides an upper bound of the sum of the true cost.

First operation cost only 2.

### Potential method for Dynamic Table

- start with an initial data structure D<sub>0</sub>
- operation **i** transform D<sub>i-1</sub> to  D<sub>i</sub>
- the cost of operation **i** is c<sub>i</sub>
- Define the potential function as:
	- Φ(D<sub>i</sub>)=2i-2<sup>log(i)</sup> (log approximated for excess and log 0=0)

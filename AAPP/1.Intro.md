# Objectives 
The course deal with advanced topics in algorithm design and parallel programming.
it is structured in 2 part:
1. The first part focuses on general methods and algorithms.
2. the second part deals with parallel programming, this is the list of topic that will be discussed
	- Automatic vs Manual parallelization
	- Parallelizing compilers
	- Parallel Patterns 
	- Partitioning 
	- Communication
	- Data Dependencies tools/ languages (Open mp, MPI)

# What i think is important
for each algorithms presented is important to be able to describe how they work, know its complexity and make comparison between related algorithms
It is also important to be able to describe algorithm in relation to the category they belong (merge sort -> divide et conquer...)

# Why parallel programming
In the today scene the most of existing algorithms are sequential, and also developer are used to think in a sequential way, this happen because until few years ago the architecture that we had were built with a single core: nowadays the architecture have multiple core with an high degree of parallelism (they can execute different instruction/task at the same time).
For this reason is important to start to think to parallel algorithm, and not just try to make the existing one parallel.

Parallel algorithm are useful for several thing: 
- **Time saving**: parallel algorithm can be more performant than sequential one, they may require less time
- **Money saving**: a parallel architecture composed of cheap components can be less expansive than a single processor architecture composed of a costly processor
- **Solve Grand Challenge problems**, i.e. problems that in practice can be solved only exploiting parallelism because of their complexity.
In addition nowadays it is important exploiting parallel algorithm because the size of the problem is always increasing (Machine Learning) and so we can refer to [[4.Parallel Machine Model#Gustafson's Law|Gustafson's Law]].

## Moore's law
The Moore's law says: 
- ==the number of transistors incorporated in a chip will approximately double every 24 months.==

![[Pasted image 20231207190554.png]]As we can see from 1970 to 2016 this were true, but in the last years we have noticed a change in the trend: this is because have to much transistor per chip consume a lot, in fact in the last 10 year the **typical power** per chip did non change a lot:

If we want to maintain the same Power consumption we cannot increase the frequency of the processors anymore.

So the trend in the last years was not increase the number of transistor per chip but increase the number of chip.

So now the question is [[2.Program Parallel Architecture|how we can program a multi-core architecture?]]

# The problem

**input**: a set A of (distinct) number and an integer i, with 1<=i<=n

**output**: The element x belonging to A with rank "i" that is larger than exactly i-1 other elements of A. **Practically is the item that, once that the array have been sorted is in position "i"**.

## special case
For these case is not needed to sort the vector.
- i=1 -> find the minimum
- i=n -> find the maximum
- i=(n+1)/2 lower or upper median (depend on the approximation) 

## First idea 
A first idea is to sort the vector and then to take the element in position i.
The worst case of this is Theta(n log(n)) using merge sort or heap sort.

Can we have a linear time selection procedure? so find the element of rank i in a linear time

# Linear time selection
There are two way to implement a linear time selection procedure:
- [[5.Randomized Based Algorithms|Randomized]] [[3.Divide and Conquer|Divide and Conquer]] algorithm, that is linear in average
- Deterministic version, that is linear in the worst case.
## Randomized Divide and conquer algorithm

The idea here that partition split the array in two parts, one that is less that the pivot and the other that is greater, we can exploit this : if i is less than the pivot we have to look in the first part, if i is greater we have to look in the second part.
**notice that in the second case you have to look for the item in the relative position, so the i-k item!**
if **i** = **k** we have found the item!

### Analysis
We can use the [[2. Analysis of algorithms#The Master Method|Master Method]] to solve the recurrence formula
#### lucky case
T(n)=T(9n/10) +Theta(n) -> Theta(n)
#### unlucky case
T(n)=T(n-1) +Theta(n) ->Theta(n<sup>2</sup>)
#### average case
With a demonstration similar to the one done for the quick sort we can say that the average case has an upper bound of **cn**, with a average case Theta(n).
the average case is the most frequent one
### Conclusion
• Works fast: linear expected time.
• Excellent algorithm in practice.
• But, the worst case is very bad: theta(n<sup>2</sup>).

## Deterministic Algorithm
This algorithm was born from the randomized one, it tries to make the worst case in linear time.

What change is how we chose the pivot element

in fact, as we can see, step 3 and 4 are exactly the same of the randomized algorithm(same recoursion).

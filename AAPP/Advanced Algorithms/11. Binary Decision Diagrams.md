A Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) is a data structure that is used to represent a Boolean function.

**Quick recap on our notation**
- a ⋅ b= ab =a and n
- a + b= a or b
- v' = not v

# Idea
The aim of the BDDs is to represent the Boolean function without enumerate all possible combination for all possible variable.
In fact one way to represent the function is in a table like this:

```
| A | B | A ⋅ B |
|---|---|-------|
| 0 | 0 |   0   |
| 0 | 1 |   0   |
| 1 | 0 |   0   |
| 1 | 1 |   1   |
```
But in some function some part are replicated, and when we want to evaluate the function maybe we do work that is already done.

### Key
- **unique table**: find identical sub-cases and avoid replication
- **computed table**: reduce redundant computation of sub-cases

### Other good things
- We can obtain a canonical (unique) BDD, this can be used to shift the SAT problem (Boolean satisfiability problem) from algorithm to the representation. 
- They are efficient on a lot of logical operation

# ROBDDs
The ROBDDs (Reduced and Ordered BDDs) are:
- Directed acyclic graph (DAG)
- one root node 
- two terminals 0, 1
- each node has two children and a variable

The ROBDDs are built starting from the **Shannon co-factoring tree** that is a concept used in Boolean algebra and logic, but then two operation are done on this tree are done:
1. Reduced:
	- any node with two identical children is removed
	-  two nodes with isomorphic BDDs are merged
2. Ordered:
	- Co-factoring variables (splitting variables) always follow the same order along all paths: xi1 < xi2 < xi3 < ... < xin

## Shannon Co-factoring Tree

The Shannon Co-factoring Tree, also known as the Shannon Decomposition or Expansion, is a technique used in Boolean algebra to simplify and analyze Boolean functions.
The Shannon Co-factoring Tree involves breaking down a complex Boolean function into a combination of smaller functions, making it more manageable. This is achieved through a recursive process of variable selection and partitioning.

### Example

Let's consider the Boolean function:

F(A, B, C) = A'BC + AB'C + ABC

1. **Initial Function**:
   - The original function F is a sum of three product terms.

2. **Selection of Variable**:
   - Choose one of the input variables, e.g., A.

3. **Partition the Function**:
   - Create two sub-functions based on the assumption of variable A being true (1) and false (0):
     - F1 (A=1) = BC
     - F0 (A=0) = B'C + BC

4. **Recursion**:
   - Repeat the Shannon co-factoring process for each sub-function:
     - For F1, select variable B and partition it.
     - For F0, select variable B and partition it further.

5. **Termination**:
   - Continue the recursion until sub-functions can no longer be simplified. The result is a simplified+ BC expression.

Now, let's obtain a simplified sub-functions:

- F1 (A=1) = BC
- F0 (A=0) = B'C + C

To obtain the final simplified function, we combine the results from both branches:

F(A, B, C) = F1 (A=1) + F0 (A=0) F(A, B, C) = BC + (B'C + C)

Now, simplify the expression by combining like terms:

F(A, B, C) = BC + B'C + C

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. The correct final simplified expression for the original function is F(A, B, C) = BC + B'C + C.

## Ordered BDD
In an **Ordered BDD** there is a order between variables and each path from root to sink visit node with label (label=variable) in ascending order:

## Reduced Ordered BDD
Taken a Ordered BDD we can reduce it following 2 rules:
1. if the two children of a node are the same, the node is eliminated 
2. if two nodes are parent of isomorphic graphs, they are replaced by one of them(one node instead of two). These two rules make it so that each node represents a distinct logic function

## good things
Many of operation will cost a complexity that depend on the complexity of the graph and no on the complexity of the initial expression
if you have a small amount of vertex describing a boolean function (doing the or or the and) the complexity of evaluating the function is related to the size of the graph
**this is possible because we are using dynamic programming in order to reuse all previous computation**
This is describing a function in a canonical way (like truth table) but the size is not related to 2<sup>n</sup>
## How these operation are done?
In order to evaluate expression in BDDs we have two tables:
- **Unique Table**: Is a table that describe all the function that we may have. Each vertex represent a boolean function. In the table you are going to find all the vertex as a triple (vertex, child left, child right). Any time child left and right are equal you are going to remove the vertex. in case you are pointing to the same things you are sharing the sub-graph.
- **Computed Table**: Is used to store computation, each computation is stored under a key: if that computation re-happen along the overall computation you are going to re-use the same result.
  We are basically using the [[10.  Dynamic Programming#Memoization|Memoization Technique]]

**Discuss why dynamic programming matter for Binary Decision Diagrams (BDD) data structure.**
Dynamic programming is a powerful technique in computer science and mathematics that is often used to optimize solutions to problems by breaking them down into smaller sub-problems and storing the results of these sub-problems for future reference. This technique can significantly improve the efficiency of algorithms, and it is particularly important for Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs), a data structure used in various areas of computer science, including formal verification, model checking, and symbolic analysis. Here's why dynamic programming matters for BDDs:

1. Efficient representation of Boolean functions: BDDs are primarily used to represent and manipulate Boolean functions, which are functions that operate on binary values (true or false). These functions can become extremely complex, with a large number of variables and combinations. Dynamic programming allows BDDs to efficiently represent these functions by breaking them down into smaller, manageable subproblems.
    
2. Recursive structure of BDDs: BDDs have a recursive structure where a large problem is divided into smaller subproblems. Dynamic programming is well-suited for such problems because it provides a way to solve the subproblems just once and store the results for future use. In the context of BDDs, this means that you can optimize the construction and manipulation of BDDs by caching and reusing results for subproblems, reducing redundant computation.
    
3. Memory efficiency: One of the key advantages of BDDs is their compact representation of Boolean functions. Dynamic programming allows BDDs to maintain this compactness by sharing common subgraphs among different parts of a Boolean function. When dynamic programming is used to construct BDDs, it can identify and exploit opportunities for sharing subproblems, which leads to more memory-efficient representations.
    
4. Reduction of exponential blow-up: BDDs can experience exponential growth in size as the number of variables in a Boolean function increases. Dynamic programming helps mitigate this issue by efficiently encoding the Boolean function using shared subgraphs, which can significantly reduce the size of the BDD and make it more manageable.
    
5. Operations on BDDs: Dynamic programming can be applied to optimize various operations on BDDs, such as conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR), negation (NOT), and existential quantification. These operations often involve recursive traversal of BDDs and can benefit from dynamic programming techniques to avoid redundant work.
    

In summary, dynamic programming is crucial for Binary Decision Diagrams because it allows for efficient representation and manipulation of Boolean functions. By breaking down complex problems into smaller subproblems and reusing results, dynamic programming reduces computation time, conserves memory, and helps manage the exponential growth of BDDs, making them a practical and efficient data structure for symbolic analysis and formal verification tasks.

# The divide and conquer paradigm
The divide and conquer paradigm is a way to design recursive algorithm.
The divide and conquer algorithms are separated in 3 phases
1. **Divide**: Divide the problem (instance) into sub-problems
2. **Conquer**: Solve the sub-problems recursively 
3. **Combine**: Combine the sub-problem solution 
## Merge sort
The merge sort is an algorithm implemented with the divide and conquer paradigm.
1. **Divide**: divide the array in 2 sub arrays
2. **Conquer**: recursively (so using merge sort) sort the 2 sub arrays
3. **Combine**: combine the two sorted arrays in linear time
The base case of this recursion is the array with 1 element, that is sorted for definition.

## Binary Search
The binary search is another Divide and conquer Algorithm, it works on the assumptions that the array is sorted. You also have to know the size of the problem, if you have to calculate it you need linear time, so no improvement with the respect of a normal search. 
1. **Divide**: Check the middle element
2. **Conquer**: Recursively search in 1 sub-array.
3. **Combine**: just say if the element is present
**Algorithm description**: Split the array in 2 part, check the middle element: if it is greater than what i was looking for call binary search on the first chunk, otherwise in the second chunk.

## Powering a number
The problem of compute the n-th power of a number can be described recursively, in a divide and conquer fashion.
Again the cost are calculated with the [[2. Analysis of algorithms#The Master Method |Master Method]]:
![[Pasted image 20230927173741.png]]
there is no 2T(n/2) because once you have calculated a<sup>n/2</sup> you can reuse that value, there is no reason to recalculate that value!

The master method apply in its 2nd case
a=1, k=0-> T(n)=theta(lg(n))
## Matrix Multiplication
### Definition of the problem
Matrix multiplication is a mathematical operation that combines two matrices to produce a new matrix. It involves multiplying the rows of the first matrix by the columns of the second matrix, resulting in a matrix with dimensions determined by the original matrices' dimensions.

**input**: A[a<sub>ij</sub>], B[b<sub>ij</sub>].
**output**: C[c<sub>ij</sub>]

### Standard Algorithm

### Divide and conquer Algorithm

The plus is a plus between 2 matrix, element by element.
naturally the part of the problem that does the multiplication is the recursive one.
**Analysis of this algorithm:**

In this case apply a divide and conquer is not better than the standard algorithm.

### Strassen's algorithm

Using the same structure as before (same division part):
![[Pasted image 20231021114305.png]]
This algorithms is able to calculate the multiplication between 2x2 matrices with only 7 recursive multiplication:

**Combine part**

## VLSI LAYOUT
### Problem Definition
The problem ask to embed a complete binary tree with n leaves in a grid using minimal area.
![[Pasted image 20231021120927.png]]
the goal is to minimize the area to have a smaller chip.
H(n) is the high of the binary tree, calculated with the recursive formula
W(n) is how wide is the area of the grid, calculated with the recursive formula.
the area is just the multiplication of H and W. 


### H-tree embedding
the same problem, but each node has 4 child.

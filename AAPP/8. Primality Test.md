# The Problem
An integer p >= 2 is prime if and only if (a is a divisor of p -> a = 1 or a=p )
Given an integer p, we want to say if it is prime or not

# Naive approach
```python
if n == 2:
    return True
if n % 2 == 0:
    return False
for i in range(1, sqrt(n) + 1):
    if (2*i + 1) % n == 0:
        return False
return True

```
If n is an odd number (greater than 2), it proceeds to the following loop:
It iterates from i=1 to sqrt(n). This is a common optimization in primality testing. You only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to sqrt(n)​ because if n has a divisor greater than sqrt(n)​, it must also have a divisor smaller than or equal to sqrt(n).

**The complexity of this algorithm is Theta(sqrt(n)).**

# Randomized Primality test
We want to build a [[5.Randomized Based Algorithms#Las Vegas and Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] algorithm, with polynomial time complexity to determine if a number is prime or not:
- if answer is **not prime** then n is not prime.0
- if answer is **prime** then the probability that n is not prime is at most p>0
As we did for other Monte Carlo Algorithm we can exploit multiple iteration to play with probability: **with k iteration the probability that n is not prime is at most p<sup>k</sup>.** 
## Prerequisites
In order to built such an algorithm we need some definition
### First Fermat observation
**Each odd prime number p divides 2<sup>p-1</sup> -1.**
so we can built this simple primality test to check if n is not prime:

1. Calculate z = 2<sup>n-1</sup> mod n
2. If z equals 1,
3. Then n is possibly prime.
4. Else n is composite.

z has to be 1 because in the calculation we removed the " -1 " of the number, so the rest of the division is greater by one. we can change the algorithm using:
- z = (2<sup>n-1</sup> -1)mod n
and then compare z with zero.

### Pseudo-prime Number
A natural number n>=2 is a base-2 pseudo-prime **if n is composite** and 
**2<sup>n-1</sup> mod n=1**


### Fermat's little Theorem
If **p is prime** and 0 < a < p, then **a<sup>p-1</sup> mod p = 1**.
notice that this is a single way implication, in fact:
- n is said to be **pseudo-prime to base a** if it is not prime and **a<sup>n-1</sup> mod n=1**
### Carmicheal numbers
A number n>=2 is a Carmichael number if n is composite and for any **a** with **GCD(a, n) = 1** we have **a<sup>n-1</sup> mod n=1**



## Randomized primality test 1
the first attempt exploit the Fermat's little theorem and the pseudo-prime to base a definition 

1. Randomly chose a in the range [2, n-1]
2. calculate a<sup>n-1</sup> mod n
3. if a<sup>n-1</sup> mod n=1 
	- then **n is possible prime**
	- else **n is composite**

## Randomized primality test 2

This second algorithm is based on a theorem:
- if **p** is prime and 0<**a**< **p** the only solution to the equation **a<sup>2</sup> mod p =1** are **a=1** and **a=p-1**.
- if **p** is not prime there are **a**, called **non- trivial square root of 1 mod n** such that a!=1 and a!= n-1 but **a<sup>2</sup> mod p =1**.

We can exploit this theorem: during the computation of a<sup>n-1</sup> we test if there is a non trivial square root mod n.

### Algorithm chosen for computing the power

The function below computes a<sup>p</sup> mod n and check during the computation whether there is an x such that **x<sup>2</sup> mod n=1** and **x!=1** and **x!=n-1**
``` c
power(int a, int p, int n) {
    if (p == 0) return 1;
    x = power(a, p/2, n);
    result = (x * x) % n;
    // check if (x*x) mod n = 1
    if (result == 1 && x != 1 && x != n –1 )
		isProbablyPrime = false;
	if (p % 2 == 1)
		result = (a * result) % n;
	return result;
}
```
It exploit all the things we have seen in the [[3.Divide and Conquer#Powering a number|Divide and Conquer]] lesson.
The complexity of this is **O(log<sup>2</sup> (n) * log(p))**

### The algorithm
```c
primalityTest(int n) {
/* executes the randomized primality test for a
chosen at random*/
	a = random(2, n-1);
	isProbablyPrime = true;
	result = power(a, n-1, n);
	if (result != 1 || !isProbablyPrime)
		return false;
	else
		return true;
}
```
if n is composite there are at most n-9/4 integers a such that 0<a < n for which the primality test fails.

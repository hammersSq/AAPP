# The Problem
An integer p >= 2 is prime if and only if (a is a divisor of p -> a = 1 or a=p )
Given an integer p, we want to say if it is prime or not

# Naive approach
```python
if n == 2:
    return True
if n % 2 == 0:
    return False
for i in range(1, sqrt(n) + 1):
    if (2*i + 1) % n == 0:
        return False
return True

```
If n is an odd number (greater than 2), it proceeds to the following loop:
It iterates from i=1 to sqrt(n). This is a common optimization in primality testing. You only need to check divisibility by odd numbers up to sqrt(n)​ because if n has a divisor greater than sqrt(n)​, it must also have a divisor smaller than or equal to sqrt(n).

**The complexity of this algorithm is Theta(sqrt(n)).**

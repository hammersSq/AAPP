Randomization can not happen only in the execution of an algorithm but even in the way in which a data structure is defined.
We are going to see two randomized data structures:
- Random Treaps
- Skip List
 
# Dictionary
A dictionary is a collection of elements each of which has a **unique search key**.

## The dictionary problem
Given the universe **(U,<)** as the set of keys with a total order we want to maintain the set S ⊆ U under the following operation:
- search(x,S) -> is x in S>
- insert (x,S) -> insert x in S if not already in S
- Delete(x,s) -> Delete x from S

Other operation that can be used on the dictionary's key:
- min(S)
- max(S)
- list(S) ->output all element in S with increasing order
- Union(S1,S2)
- split(S, x, S1, S2) split in S1 and S2(in S1 if lower than x else S2)

## Arrays for Dictionary
### Unsorted
![[Pasted image 20231031183023.png]]
- Searching and removing takes O(n)
- insert takes O(1)
Useful to log file, frequent insertion and rare search and removals
### Ordered
- search takes O(log(n)) time with Binary Search
- inserting and removing takes O(n) time
- application to look-up tables (frequent searches, rare insertions and removals)
... other implementation, not relevant

# Random Treaps
## The idea
The idea born from a fact:
- if n elements are inserted in random order into a binary search tree, the expected depth is 1.39 log(n)
So someone think: can we build a tree that has the structure of a tree where the elements was inserted at random?
In order to do this is used the **priority**, a number randomly chosen and assigned to each elements.
## Definition
**A treap is a binary tree** such that:
- Each node contains one **element x, with key(x) ∈ U and prio(x) ∈ R**
- The following properties hold:
	1. (Tree properties)For each element x: 
		- elements y in the left subtree of x satisfy: key(y) < key(x)
		- elements y in the right subtree of x satisfy : key(y) > key(x)
	2. (Heap Properties)For all elements x,y:
		- If y is a child of x, then prio(y) > prio(x)
		- All priorities are pairwise distinct.

## Search operation
The search operation is similar to the one in a normal binary tree:
``` pseudocode
1. v := root;
2. while v ≠ nil do
3.   case key(v) = k:
4.     stop; "Element found" (successful search)
5.   key(v) < k:
6.     v := RightChild(v);
7.   key(v) > k:
8.     v := LeftChild(v);
9.   endcase;
10. endwhile;
11. "Element not found" (unsuccessful search)
```
### Analysis of the search
The running time of the search is **number of element on the search path**, But can be proved that:

and

where:

In summary those things says that the complexity is something that is log(n) dependent!

## Insertion operation
```pseudocode
1. Choose prio(x). //in a random way
2. Search for the position of x in the tree.
3. Insert x as a leaf.
4. Restore the heap property.
	while prio(parent(x)) > prio(x) do
		if x is left child then RotateRight(parent(x))
		else RotateLeft(parent(x));
		endif
	endwhile
```
The important phase is the restoring heap property, we have to move up the inserted leaf until it has a position that respect the heap property but at the same time we don' t have to break the binary search tree property. We can use rotation:
![[Pasted image 20231101220336.png]]


### Analysis of the Insertion
We know that step 1 and 3 takes constant time, step 2 takes **log(n)**.
How many time to restore the heap property?
In the worst case we have to do log(n) rotation(a leaf need to be the radix), but the average case is much better than that!
**The expected running time of insert and delete operations is
O(log n). The expected number(average case) of rotations is 2.**

## Deletion of an element
```pseudocode
1.Find x in the tree.
2. while x is not a leaf do
		u := child with smaller priority;
		if u is left child then RotateRight(x))
		else RotateLeft(x);
		endif;
	endwhile;
1. Delete x;
```
Still we need to keep the heap property, we only can delete leaf...so rotate until the element to delete is a leaf!
### Analysis of Deletion
same as insertion
**The expected running time of insert and delete operations is
O(log n). The expected number(average case) of rotations is 2.**

## Split operation
![[Pasted image 20231101221157.png]]
### Analysis of Split
**The expected running time of the operations Union and Split is O(log n).**

## Union
![[Pasted image 20231101221246.png]]
To do the step 1 you will look for the max of T1 and the min of T2
### Analysis of Union
**The expected running time of the operations Union and Split is O(log n).**

## Other operation

## How to generate the priority?
We don't want two elements have the same priority

# Skip List
The skip list is a simple randomized dynamic search structure. It maintains a dynamic set of n element and provide a O(log(n)) time per operation with high probability.

## The idea
The idea for this data structure comes from the subway lines of New York:
- Express line connects a few line
- Local line connects all station 
- Links are placed in strategic place between lines and common station.
![[Pasted image 20231102121251.png]]
In practical this is implemented with 2 (o more) linked list, when we want to search for an item we first look in the upper list, until we reach an element that is lower than the one we are searching and the next one is greater: In this case we go down and we will search the element in the bottom list.

## The implementation
It is proved that in order to have the best search complexity for this structure we need **log(n)** sorted list, that lead to a cost **2 log(n)**.
![[Pasted image 20231102121651.png]]

This clearly offer a good search time but what about the insertion?

## Insert(x)
To insert an element x into a skip list we have to:
- Search(x) to see where x fits in bottom list
- Insert x in that position
In this way we always have all the element in the bottom list.

Now we have to decide if we have to add x in the other lists, and here come in the game the randomization,**We can randomly decide whether or not promote x no the next level**:
- 1/2 of elements promoted to 0 levels
- 1/4 of elements promoted to 1 levels
- 1/8 of elements promoted to 2 levels
- ... and so on

## Delete(x)
To delete an element x from a skip list we just need to delete it from all the lists.

## Complexity
It is proved that with high probability every search in a skip list costs O(log(n))
